* CL-NIX-PROJECT
This is a wrapper around [[https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project][fukamachi's cl-project]].

When a new project is created, first [[https://github.com/teu5us/cl-nix-project-skeleton][the nix skeleton]] is cloned to the specified
directory, then cl-project places its files inside there.

The nix skeleton tries to reuse facilities available in nixpkgs to build Common
Lisp systems and provide a development shell. In the shell sbcl is wrapped with
the ~lisp~ script, that loads linedit according to its [[https://common-lisp.net/project/linedit/][manual]]. Have a read to
set up Emacs correctly.
* Installation
Can be installed with ~nix-env -f https://github.com/teu5us/cl-nix-project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -i cl-nix-project~.

Or you can run the thing directly from github: ~nix run github:Teu5us/cl-nix-project -- ARGUMENTS ...~.
